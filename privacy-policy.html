                    <h5>Changes to the privacy policy and your duty to inform us of changes</h5>
                    <p>

                        It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your
                        personal data changes during your relationship with us.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Third-party links</h5>
                    <p>
                        Our website and app may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or
                        enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these thirdparty websites and we are not responsible for their privacy statements.

                    <h3>2. The data we collect about you</h3>
                    <p>
                        Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be
                        identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together
                        as follows:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Identity Data</strong> includes first name, maiden name, last name, username or similar identifier, date of birth and gender.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Contact Data</strong> includes email address and telephone numbers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Technical Data</strong> includes internet protocol (IP) address, your login data, browser type and version, time
                            zone setting and geo-location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform, and
                            other technology on the devices you use to access this app.</li>

                            feedback, the football clubs that you support, records of any contests you have participated in on our app
                            and your winnings, your activities during those contents, the details of your interactions with our in-app
                            sporting news articles, your history of using our app and any other users that you have added as friends
                            on the app. </li>
                        <li><strong>Usage Data</strong> includes information about how you use our app, website, products and services and how you
                            play our games. </li>

                    <p>
                        We also collect, use and share <strong>Aggregated Data</strong>, such as statistical or demographic data, for any purpose. Aggregated
                        Data could be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data will <strong>not</strong> directly

                        accessing a specific website or app feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal
                        data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data, which will be used
                        in accordance with this privacy policy.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        offences.
                    </p>

                    <h5>If you fail to provide personal data</h5>
                    <p>Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to
                        provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into
                        with you (for example, to provide you with goods or services). In this case, we may have to cancel a product or service
                        you have with us, but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.</p>

                    <p>
                        We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the
                        following circumstances:
                    </p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and
                            fundamental rights, do not override those interests.</li>
                        <li>Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
                    </ul>

                        consent before sending third-party direct marketing communications to you via email or text message or before we
                        share your details with any football clubs. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by
                        contacting us.

                        <p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. We have established the following personal data control mechanisms:</p>

                            <li><strong>Promotional offers from us:</strong> We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form
                                a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide
                                which products, services, new games and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing). </li>
                            <li><strong>Not opting out:</strong> You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information
                                from us or entered a contest on our app, and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.</li>
                            <li><strong>Third-party marketing:</strong> We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with
                                any third party for marketing purposes. </li>
                            <li><strong>Opting out:</strong> You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by emailing
                                us or by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting us at any time.
                                Where you opt out of receiving our marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to
                                us as a result of you entering a contest on the app, providing details of your product/service experience

                        <p>Access to our personal data databases is restricted and only individuals with validated queries and a business reason
                            may gain access. Neither our developers nor service managers have direct instances to our personal data databases.
                            All actions are logged. Data is not kept at any personal devices, nor can it be copied to a USB stick or remote storage
                            drive.</p>
                        <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any
                            applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

                        <h3>8. Data retention</h3>
                        <h5>How long will you use my personal data for?</h5>
                        <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for,
                            including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain
                            your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of
                            litigation in respect to our relationship with you.</p>
                        <p>
                            To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of
                            the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes
                            for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the
                            applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements. We utilise automated database scripts to delete
                            the majority of the personal data that we hold. Typically speaking:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We retain Technical Data for a maximum of one year and Usage Data for an extended duration;</li>
                            <li>Transaction Data and some Financial data, such as fraud, we will retain for six years; and</li>
                            <li>Most other data we will retain for as long you have the AXXS app installed for, plus two years.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available in our retention policy which you
                            can request from us by contacting us.</p>

                        <p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see “Your legal rights” below for further information.</p>
                        <p>In some circumstances we will anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for
                            research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you. </p>
                        <h3>9. Your legal rights</h3>
                        <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Request access to your personal data.</li>
                            <li>Request correction of your personal data.</li>
                            <li>Request erasure of your personal data.</li>
                            <li>Object to processing of your personal data.</li>
                            <li>Request restriction of processing your personal data.</li>
                            <li>Request transfer of your personal data.</li>
                            <li>Right to withdraw consent.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.</p>
                        <h5>Usually no fee required</h5>
                        <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may
                            charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to
                            comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
                        <h5>What we may need from you</h5>
                        <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access
                            your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is
                            not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information
                            in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
                        <h5>Time limit to respond</h5>
                        <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if
                            your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep
                            you updated.</p>
                        <h3>10. Glossary</h3>
                        <h5>LAWFUL BASIS</h5>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give
                            you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any
                            potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our
                            legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact
                            on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further
                            information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific
                            activities by contacting us.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Performance of Contract</strong> means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which
                            you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Comply with a legal obligation</strong> means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal
                            obligation that we are subject to.
                        </p>
                        <h5>THIRD PARTIES</h5>
                        <p><strong>External Third Parties</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Service providers acting as processors based in the EU who provide IT, system administration services and marketing services.</li>
                            <li>Professional advisers based in the EU or UK acting as processors or joint controllers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.</li>
                            <li>Professional football clubs to whom we will only transfer your personal data with your consent.</li>
                            <li>Any subsidiaries or holding companies who need to receive your personal data in order to allow us to fulfil our obligations under this privacy policy or any agreement that we may have with you.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h5>
                        <p>You have the right to:</p>
                        <p><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to
                            receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
                        <p><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate
                            data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is
                            no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal
                            data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have
                            processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.
                            Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which
                            will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and
                            there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as
                            you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing
                            your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling
                            legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Request restriction</strong> of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your
                            personal data in the following scenarios:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.</li>
                            <li>Where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
                            <li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or
                                defend legal claims.</li>
                            <li>You have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate
                                grounds to use it.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have
                            chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies
                            to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to
                            perform a contract with you. </p>
                        <p><strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> when we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not
                            affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent,
                            we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you
                            withdraw your consent.</p>
